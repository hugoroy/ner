TODO
====

- Better configuration parser: right now it just barely works for the default
  notmuch config file.
- Configurable key bindings: allow the user to configure which bindings they
  want to use.
- Implement message viewing in ThreadView.
- Configurable colors and UI.
- Clear the input key sequence when there is no longer any matching bindings.
- Make the statusbar better. Maybe expand it to two lines, one for input and
  the other for actual status information.
- Sending and replying to email.
- Convert subject and authors from UTF-8 to UTF-32 and use ncursesw to display
  the result.
